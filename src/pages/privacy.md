I respect the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this policy document explains how I collect and handle any information you provide to me.

**What background data is collected?**
This site uses third party trackers that collect anonymized data about how this site is being used and it's performance.

**How do I use the data you provide?**
The data collected by third party trackers are used to improve usability, stability, and design of this site.

**How secure is your data?**
The data is collected and maintained only by third parties that adhere to all U.S., U.K., and EU law in regards to data protection and privacy.

**How secure is this website?**
This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server.

This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site. All relevant response HTTP headers are set for your protection and the Content Security Policy is adjusted to this websites requirements.

user data is collected so this is the only means of notification.
