## Bat

There are some eternal tools and `cat` is one of them. It has not appreciably changed much for an eternity. Recently I have stumbled upon a site called [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com/). A tool missng from their posts is the tool [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat). As a developer, and perhaps many Linux users, when I am using `cat` it is with a script or log snippet. However, without perks like colorization and line numbers it can be difficult to comprehend. This may lead a user to open it in `vi` or `helix` to get those benefits. What if you didn't have to? That's where `bat` enters the picture.

This is what `bat` looks like with a simple basic toml file.

But `bat` is also capable of showing white space, is git-aware, and by default uses `less` for paging.

`bat -A keyboards/ploopyco/ploopyco.h`

It also can read from stdin

There is a wide range of options including those that allow you to customize the output, add themes, and return to default `cat` behavior for example.

```bash
‚ùØ cat -h
A cat(1) clone with wings.

## Install

The installation is straight forward. If you have the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain installed building from source is an option.

`cargo install --locked bat`

Or using your package manager.

`sudo zypper install bat bat-bash-completion bat-fish-completion`

## Integrate with Fish

As seen above there are fish completions available on OpenSUSE. One option to avoid muscle memory of typing `cat` vs `bat` would be to use a fish alias but that isn't quite enough. There is a convinience flag that is just too much typing to get a pagerless output. This custom override for the `cat` command gives you a nice flag to get basic output as well as only overriding the `cat` command in interactive mode.

```sh
# Utilizes bat when in user shell to get prettier code prints but
# reverts to cat when not to prevent interfering with other scripts.
function cat --description "alias cat bat"
    if status --is-interactive
        # Replace and substitute -a with --pager=never
        set -l args (string replace -a -- "-a" "--pager=never" $argv)
        # In interactive mode, use bat
        command bat $args
    else
        # In non-interactive mode, use cat
        command cat $argv
    end
end

```

As seen above the override only happens under interactive use. Additionally, it adds flag `-a` as an alias of `--pager=never` to save a few keystrokes. The command now to get plain `cat` output would be `cat -a -p`. Using the keyword `command` to execute `cat` and `bat` also maintains the correct fish completions based on the underlying command being run.


_That is all for this installment. Look forward to more posts just like this._
