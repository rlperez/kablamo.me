## Projects

One thing that was missing here was a page to list current projects. That
now [exists](/projects). The current projects list only consists of this
[project](https://github.com/rlperez/kablamo.me) and a Clojure project,
[pgmq-clj](https://github.com/rlperez/pgmq-clj), that I developed to wrap
the [pgmq](https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq) Postgres extension. There will
be an additional post about `pgmq-clj` but in summary it adds some boilerplate
to make using the pgmq extension queues easier in Clojure. It is very
early in development but it is being used in a closed source project currently
in work. Using `pgmq` is allowing the async processing of messages without any
additional infrastructure besides the database already in use until it is needed.
The PGMQ extension is also available on [supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/queues).
